# discordr

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of discordr is to ease the sending of messages from R sessions to discord servers. Current implementations allow for messages, embeds and files to be sent.

## Installation

You can install the development version of discordr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("nbryder/discordr")
```

## Note

The functionality assumes that you are able to generate a webhook for your discord server, google instructions if you are unaware of how to to this. The webhook URL should never be stored in published documents, for the purpose of this tutorial it is assumed you have it stored as DISCORD_HOOK_URL in an .renviron file.
